## Expenses tracker
This repository is a **Next.js** application designed for managing and tracking expenses. It allows users to:


- **Add Expenses**: Users can input details about expenses, including description, amount, who paid, and who shared the expense.

- **Upload Receipts**: Users can upload PDF receipts associated with each expense, which are stored in Supabase Storage.


- **View Expense List**: A list of all recorded expenses is displayed, showing details such as the amount, who paid, and who shared the expense.


- **Calculate Balances**: The application calculates and displays the balances for each participant, indicating how much they owe or are owed.


## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
